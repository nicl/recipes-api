Lay thin slices of cheese over the buttered toast ensuring no bread is left showing, to prevent scorching. Place the slices under a feisty heat and the savoury is complete when the cheese is bubbling. Now add the vital addition of Worcestershire sauce and freshly milled black pepper. Once plated, it must be eaten immediately, the surface bubbling from the heat of the grill."

The head chef, Keith Podmore, had a recipe that required the considerable reducing of stout which was then thickened in a pan with thoroughly cooked flour and butter, enriched with a great heap of grated cheddar, a dollop of mustard, much Worcestershire sauce, plenty of pepper and a couple of egg yolks. The subject of egg yolk is contentious.'"
